                    <p>
                        Enumerations constitute a pivotal element of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). 
                        References to enumerated artifacts are utilized to support a universal understanding and integrate threat information. 
                        While traditional IT systems and related vulnerabilities are covered by security enumerations, the same does not apply to Cyber-Physical Systems~(CPS) in their entirety. 
                        In particular, complexity and interdependencies of components within these systems demand for an extension of current enumerations. 
                        Taking on a CPS security management perspective this work identifies deficiencies within the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) enumeration. 
                        New conceptual meta models for CPS are proposed to cover the aspects comprehensiveness and usability of security enumerations. 
                        A prototypical search engine application is used to evaluate the feasibility of the approach by demonstrating key features of security enumerations for CPS.

                        This application shows an prototypical implementation of the concept presented within the paper.
