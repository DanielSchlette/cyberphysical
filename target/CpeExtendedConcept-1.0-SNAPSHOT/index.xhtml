                    <p>
                        Enumerations constitute a pivotal element of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) as the reference to enumerated artifacts supports a universal understanding. 
                        While traditional IT-Systems and related vulnerabilities are covered by security enumerations, the same does not apply to cyber-physical systems (CPS) in their entirety. 
                        In particular, complexity and interdependencies of components within these systems demand for an extension of current enumerations. Taking on a CPS security management 
                        perspective this work identifies deficiencies within the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) enumeration.
                        Towards security enumerations for CPS new data models are proposed and evaluated with a prototypical search engine application.

                        This application shows an prototypical implementation of the concept presented within the paper.
